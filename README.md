### What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; The problem I was solving in the projects for this course was how to process a data set using various data structures. These data structures were implemented into a program whose function was to open, read, import, and organize data from a CSV file given required parameters. Project one was meant to analyze the data data structures we worked with and determine their run-time and time complexity to determine which data structure we were going to use for project two. Project two was meant to use that data structure to manipulate and/or produce a certain output by executing different functions.

### How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; I approached the problem by first trying to understand the different desired outcomes. Next, I needed to bridge the gap between the data structure and the output. I did this by conceptualizing or sketching out the structure and then the different ways I could navigate it for each function. Understanding the structure itself was the most crucial part in being able to use it take advantage of its benefits and work around or even use its drawbacks to support functions.

### How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; Most roadblocks I encountered were from my own overcomplication of concepts. I could overcome this by simply stepping away from the problem for a little while or by returning to basics and reworking my way through each concept.

### How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; My work on this project has given a better understanding of these data structures and new way to approach similar probelms. Because of this, I have made it a habit to just program for the sake of it compiling and (almost) functioning as intended. Once I have the essential code in place, I can then start optimizing and making changes.

### How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; With each activity and project I could utilize more code snippets from past programs to reduce the amount of coding I needed to do despite each assignment usually being more complex than the last. For my own sake, so I didn't have to write as much code or reinvent the wheel with each week, I made sure that not only is my code adaptable, but also easy for me to understand what it actually does. As of right now, I don't find myself programming with a team or even one other person regularly, but if I can't understand my code, how could I expect the people I work with too? These projects differ from all my previous course's projects as it didn't change the type of program to write drastically each week and this in a way, rewarded you for writing maintainable, readable, and adaptable code.
